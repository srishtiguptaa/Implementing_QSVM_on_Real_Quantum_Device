# Implementing_QSVM_on_Real_Quantum_Device

## Introduction
This project aims to implement Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) on actual quantum devices and simulators using the Qiskit library in conjunction with Amazon Braket (AWS). The core objective is to evaluate and compare the performance efficiency of QSVM implementations across various quantum hardware and simulation environments. The comparison will focus on key statistical metrics including recall, precision, F1 score, and accuracy, alongside execution time.

## Objectives

• Implement QSVM using Qiskit on real quantum devices and simulators via Amazon Braket.

• Evaluate and compare the performance of QSVM across different quantum environments.

• Measure key statistical metrics: recall, precision, F1 score, and accuracy.

• Analyze execution time for QSVM on both quantum hardware and simulators.
